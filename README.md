<b>About</b>


This is a simple command-line Scrabble game written in C++. The game allows you to input words and checks if they are valid according to a predefined dictionary.

<b>How to Play</b>


Compile the ScrabbleGame.cpp file using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++ on Linux/macOS or cl on Windows).
Run the resulting executable file.
When prompted, enter a word to check if it's valid.
The game will respond with "Valid" if the word is in the dictionary, or "Invalid" if it's not.
